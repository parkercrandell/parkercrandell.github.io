        Parker's Fun With Reno Mage 
      </h1>
      <p>This is my guide to playing the beauty that is a terrible Reno Deck. It is not really consistant and I'm stuck at rank 19 because of it, however the games I have played have been some of the greatest comebacks and overkills I've ever seen. Whether its Unstable Portal into Aviana into Golden Monkey or instant concedes after I play Reno, this is the most fun I've had in Hearthstone. So, I decided to share it and my strats with the world. </p>
